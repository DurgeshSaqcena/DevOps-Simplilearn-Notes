### Docker Overview
Docker is a container management service. The keywords of Docker are develop, ship and run anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

- [ ] How to load an existing an image
```
docker load <tar file>
```

### Explanation about Load /Save import/export and commmit

- ***save*** works with Docker images. It saves everything needed to build a container from scratch. Use this command if you want to share an image with others.

- ***load*** works with Docker images. Use this command if you want to run an image exported with save. Unlike pull, which requires connecting to a Docker registry, load can import from anywhere (e.g. a file system, URLs).

- ***export*** works with Docker containers, and it exports a snapshot of the containerâ€™s file system. Use this command if you want to share or back up the result of building an image.

- ***import*** works with the file system of an exported container, and it imports it as a Docker image. Use this command if you have an exported file system you want to explore or use as a layer for a new image.
